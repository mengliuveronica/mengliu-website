abstract: "The UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee has called
  for evidence on the roles that different stakeholders play in reproducibility
  and research integrity. Of central priority are proposals for improving
  research integrity and quality, as well as guidance and support for
  researchers. In response to this, we argue that there is one important
  component of research integrity that is often absent from discussion: the
  pedagogical consequences of how we teach, mentor, and supervise students
  through open scholarship. We justify the need to integrate open scholarship
  principles into research training within higher education and argue that
  pedagogical communities play a key role in fostering an inclusive culture of
  open scholarship. We illustrate these benefits by presenting the Framework for
  Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), an international grassroots
  community whose goal is to provide support, resources, visibility, and
  advocacy for the adoption of principled, open teaching and mentoring
  practices, whilst generating conversations about the ethics and social impact
  of higher-education pedagogy. Representing a diverse group of early-career
  researchers and students across specialisms, we advocate for greater
  recognition of and support for pedagogical communities, and encourage all
  research stakeholders to engage with these communities to enable long-term,
  sustainable change."
