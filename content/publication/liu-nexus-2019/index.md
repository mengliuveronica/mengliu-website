abstract: 'The issue of intercultural communication has garnered more attention than
  ever as the world changes with increasing mobility both physical and virtual. Such
  change not only transforms how we communicate but also foregrounds cultural differences
  and the implications of intercultural understanding. Scholarly debate on the nexus
  of language and culture has ignited considerable research effort to contextualise
  foreign language education to accommodate such changing landscape. This article
  reviews both this debate and empirical effort with two aims. First, it aims to explore
  theoretical debates on the nature of the relationship between language and culture
  to identify the theoretical underpinnings of educational practice. Second, it reviews
  relevant empirical research to reveal how the issue of language and culture has
  been addressed in foreign language classrooms. In the theoretical overview, three
  highlights in the language-culture nexus debate are summarised, followed by the
  proposed dual focus on language and culture in foreign language education. Particularly,
  a model of intercultural communicative competence (ICC) is reviewed in detail as
  the paradigmatic example of addressing both language and culture in foreign language
  education. In the empirical review, scholarly works inspired by the ICC model are
  synthesised into three different themes, namely “Developing ICC: The traditional
  classroom approach”, “Developing ICC: The telecollaboration approach” and “Assessing
  ICC”. Insights and limitations of previous studies are discussed and future research
  directions are proposed at the end.'
