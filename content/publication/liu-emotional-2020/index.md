abstract: The present study contributes to the ﬁeld of L2 motivation by exploring
  the link between emotional experience in language learning and motivational self
  from a multilingual perspective. Speciﬁcally, it evaluated the empirical support
  for the validity of the ideal multilingual self on simultaneous language learners
  in China and assessed the relationship between emotional experience (positive and
  negative) in language learning and the ideal multilingual self using structural
  equation modelling. Five hundred and twenty-three learners of English and languages
  other than English (LOTEs) in Chinese universities participated in the survey study.
  Findings established the construct validity of the ideal multilingual self and unveiled
  the signiﬁcance and complexity of the link between emotion and motivation. Speciﬁcally,
  learners reported largely similar positive experiences in learning English and LOTEs
  and positive emotions in both languages were positively linked, with equal magnitude,
  to the ideal multilingual self. The patterns involving negative emotions were less
  consistent as learners reported diﬀering negative experiences in learning the two
  languages and only negative emotion in English learning was negatively linked to
  the ideal multilingual self. The complexity of patterns brings forth a more nuanced
  understanding of the connection between emotion and multilingual motivation with
  pedagogical implications.
