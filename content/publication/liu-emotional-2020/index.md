abstract: The present study contributes to the ﬁeld of L2 motivation by
  exploring the link between emotional experience in language learning and
  motivational self from a multilingual perspective. Speciﬁcally, it evaluated
  the empirical support for the validity of the ideal multilingual self on
  simultaneous language learners in China and assessed the relationship between
  emotional experience (positive and negative) in language learning and the
  ideal multilingual self using structural equation modelling. Five hundred and
  twenty-three learners of English and languages other than English (LOTEs) in
  Chinese universities participated in the survey study. Findings established
  the construct validity of the ideal multilingual self and unveiled the
  signiﬁcance and complexity of the link between emotion and motivation.
  Speciﬁcally, learners reported largely similar positive experiences in
  learning English and LOTEs and positive emotions in both languages were
  positively linked, with equal magnitude, to the ideal multilingual self. The
  patterns involving negative emotions were less consistent as learners reported
  diﬀering negative experiences in learning the two languages and only negative
  emotion in English learning was negatively linked to the ideal multilingual
  self. The complexity of patterns brings forth a more nuanced understanding of
  the connection between emotion and multilingual motivation with pedagogical
  implications.
