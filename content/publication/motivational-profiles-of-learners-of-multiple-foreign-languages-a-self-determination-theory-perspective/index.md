abstract: Adopting a person-centred and multilingual perspective, this study
  drew on self-determination theory and used latent profile analysis to
  investigate the motivational profiles of learners of multiple foreign
  languages. Chinese tertiary-level students (N = 523), concurrently studying
  English and a language other than English (LOTE), participated in the
  research. Latent profile analysis identified four groups for English
  motivation (High Quantity, Moderate Quality, Poor Quality and Amotivated) and
  three groups for LOTEs motivation (High Quantity, Medial and Amotivated). Our
  findings revealed high between-person and between-language heterogeneity in
  profile distribution, profile combination, and profile association with
  emotions. Specifically, negative emotion was more predictive of English
  motivational quality whereas positive emotion was more predictive of LOTEs
  motivational quality. Our results also suggest that making LOTEs compulsory is
  not sufficient to motivate students, as evidenced by the Medial profile being
  the normative profile unique to LOTEs. Regarding profile combinations, the
  best performing profile (High Quantity) was also the most likely shared
  profile by the same individual. While most learners had different profiles for
  different languages, it was extremely unlikely for the same individual to have
  profiles of opposite configurations. Our findings demonstrate the utility of
  combining person-centred techniques with a multilingual perceptive to produce
  a more nuanced and precise understanding of language learning motivation.
