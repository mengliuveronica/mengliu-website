abstract: This study aimed to examine the effect of multiple domains of self-efﬁcacy
  on the relationship between shyness and subjective well-being among Chinese adolescents.
  A sample of 763 Chinese adolescents (M = 14.77 years old, SD = 1.63; 55% boys) completed
  the Shyness Scale, the Social Self-Efﬁcacy Questionnaire, the Regulatory Emotional
  SelfEfﬁcacy Questionnaire, and the Subjective Well-Being Scale. Structural equation
  model analysis showed that both regulatory emotional self-efﬁcacy and social self-efﬁcacy
  partially mediated the relationship between shyness and subjective well-being. Moreover,
  shyness negatively inﬂuenced subjective well-being through the chain of regulatory
  emotional self-efﬁcacy and social self-efﬁcacy. Overall, the ﬁndings supported the
  multiple mediating roles of selfefﬁcacy beliefs between shyness and subjective well-being,
  which enhanced our understanding of how self-efﬁcacy beliefs impact shy youths’
  subjective well-being in China. The theoretical and practical implications of these
  ﬁndings were discussed.
