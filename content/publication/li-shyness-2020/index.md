abstract: This study aimed to examine the effect of multiple domains of
  self-efﬁcacy on the relationship between shyness and subjective well-being
  among Chinese adolescents. A sample of 763 Chinese adolescents (M = 14.77
  years old, SD = 1.63; 55% boys) completed the Shyness Scale, the Social
  Self-Efﬁcacy Questionnaire, the Regulatory Emotional SelfEfﬁcacy
  Questionnaire, and the Subjective Well-Being Scale. Structural equation model
  analysis showed that both regulatory emotional self-efﬁcacy and social
  self-efﬁcacy partially mediated the relationship between shyness and
  subjective well-being. Moreover, shyness negatively inﬂuenced subjective
  well-being through the chain of regulatory emotional self-efﬁcacy and social
  self-efﬁcacy. Overall, the ﬁndings supported the multiple mediating roles of
  selfefﬁcacy beliefs between shyness and subjective well-being, which enhanced
  our understanding of how self-efﬁcacy beliefs impact shy youths’ subjective
  well-being in China. The theoretical and practical implications of these
  ﬁndings were discussed.
