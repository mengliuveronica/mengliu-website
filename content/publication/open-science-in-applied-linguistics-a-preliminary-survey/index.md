abstract: The first official step toward Open Science (OS) in Applied
  Linguistics (AL) was arguably the establishment of IRIS, a discipline-specific
  data and instrument repository, back in 2011 (Marsden et al., 2016). Since
  then, there have been active efforts to improve methodological rigour and
  research quality (eg, Gass et al., 2021; Plonsky, 2014; Plonsky et al., 2020),
  as well as initiatives to enhance research transparency, reproducibility and
  accessibility, such as Registered Reports at Language Learning (Marsden,
  Morgan-Short, et al., 2018) and the Open Accessible Summaries in Language
  Studies (OASIS) initiative (Marsden, Alferink, et al., 2018). Nevertheless,
  little is known regarding how AL researchers currently perceive and practise
  OS. High uncertainty remains regarding researchers’ beliefs and engagement in
  OS (Christensen et al., 2020). We argue that to better inform the initiatives
  led by active proponents of OS in AL, the voices of ordinary researchers (eg,
  who may not be active proponents of OS) must be understood and taken into
  account. To the best of our knowledge, only one survey of such nature has been
  conducted in the field of AL (cited in Marsden, 2019) and more efforts are
  still needed to better understand the current status of applied linguists’
  perception and practice of OS. As a step in that direction, we conducted a
  preliminary survey targeting applied linguists, covering topics such as OS
  attitudes, OS practices and perceived barriers to OS practices.
