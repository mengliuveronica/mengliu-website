On the first day of my personal new year (yep, just had my birthday yesterday üéÇ), I think it would be fun do something different for a change and here we go, welcome to my first blog post on my first personal website!(I am officially proud of myself for such a productive weekend!üíÉüèª)

It is indeed a blog worthy moment as I had quite a few firsts during the past few days, one of which was my first SIPS. Having been meaning to dip my toes in the world of Open Science for quite a while now, [SIPS2021](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SIPS2021?src=hashtag_click) gave me the opportunity to engage more actively with the greater community of psych people and think a bit deeper about the idea of OS and science reform. 

In my first [Hackathon](https://osf.io/8eavj/), I had the pleasure of spending a productive afternoon developing a [lesson plan](https://osf.io/jyp26/) on a topic that's very close to my heart: Research paradigms and OS. I truly believe this is a critial yet under-explored issue. The discourse around OS, in my view, is very much dominated by active proponents in Psychology, with the voices of "ordinary" researchers, especially those who may not be active OS advocates, largely unheard. I find myself both deeply intrigued and somewhat disturbed by the strong association between OS and the post-positivist paradigm, casting a shadow over the unresolved tension between key tenets of OS and other, equally valid and valuable, research paradigms. I firmly believe that voices from researchers subscribing to different paradigms should be heard before a meaningful reform can take place. To call back at my ostensibly philosophical title, it is time to do a bit of rethinking on what we mean by Open Science and whose Open Science we have been talking about. I don't think there are easy or ready answers to these questions, but hopefully by initiating and engaging in the conversation, we can get closer to the answer we are looking for.
